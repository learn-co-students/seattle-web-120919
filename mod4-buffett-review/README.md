This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Goals

Create an application that mimics the behavior of an all you can eat buffet.

As a user I can: 

* See a selection of food available.
* Select a food and add it to my plate. (There is no limit to the quantity of each food.)
* Eat food from my plate, removing it from view.

Stretch goals:

* Calculate the calories of my meal.

There are some methods and components in place. You will certainly need to create new methods. You may or may not need to modify or update the values held in state.

For the stretch goal, it's recommended to create new values and components, as the data needed is not currently present.
