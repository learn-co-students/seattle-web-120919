        <h1>Dutch Golden Age painting</h1>
        <p>
          Dutch Golden Age painting is the painting of the Dutch Golden Age, a
          period in Dutch history roughly spanning the 17th century, during and
          after the later part of the Eighty Years' War (1568â€“1648) for Dutch
          independence.

          The new Dutch Republic was the most prosperous nation in Europe and
          led European trade, science, and art. The northern Netherlandish
          provinces that made up the new state had traditionally been less
          important artistic centres than cities in Flanders in the south. The
          upheavals and large-scale transfers of population of the war, and the
          sharp break with the old monarchist and Catholic cultural traditions,
          meant that Dutch art had to reinvent itself entirely. The painting of
          religious subjects declined very sharply, but a large new market for
          all kinds of secular subjects grew up.

        <p>
          Although Dutch painting of the Golden Age is included in the general
          European period of Baroque painting, and often shows many of its
          characteristics, most lacks the idealization and love of splendour
          typical of much Baroque work, including that of neighbouring Flanders.
          Most work, including that for which the period is best known, reflects
          the traditions of detailed realism inherited from Early Netherlandish
          painting.
        </p>
        <p>
          A distinctive feature of the period is the proliferation of distinct
          genres of paintings, with the majority of artists producing the bulk
          of their work within one of these. The full development of this
          specialization is seen from the late 1620s, and the period from then
          until the French invasion of 1672 is the core of Golden Age painting.
          Artists would spend most of their careers painting only portraits,
          genre scenes, landscapes, seascapes and ships, or still lifes, and
          often a particular sub-type within these categories. Many of these
          types of subject were very new in Western painting, and the way the
          Dutch painted them in this period was decisive for their future
          development.
