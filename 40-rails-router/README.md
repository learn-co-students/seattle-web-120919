# React Routes
We have a single-page app for a company called Sunglasses Hut. However, the page lacks navigation with links, and customers are complaining. They can't access the details of specific glasses easily, go backward or forward using browser buttons, or navigate the site with any sense of ease.

Let's learn React Routes by improving this company's web page!

## Main Goal

  - We're not expecting memorization

## Topics to Cover

## Bonus Topics (in no specific order)

- originalSolution contains the legacy solution
- rupaSolution contains Rupa's solution (she added some stuff, OMG!)
