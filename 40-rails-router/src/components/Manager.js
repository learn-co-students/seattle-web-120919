            Hi, I'm Pete, the manager of Sunglasses Hut. I'd love to take the
            time to get to know you, but corporate is coming by in a couple
            hours, and I lost my bank deposit slip from the 16th. I'm worried
            they'll find out, and I won't get to go on the company trip to
            Cancun. I was looking forward to wearing some cool sunglasses and
            sipping on margaritas while watching cruise ships get stuck on the
            reef. I guess I'd better start looking for that slip... oh bother...
          </p>
