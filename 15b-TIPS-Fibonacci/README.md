#- Fibonacci Sequence

```
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
```

`1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34`

Example: the next number in the sequence above is 21 + 34 = 55
