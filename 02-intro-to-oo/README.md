## Objectives

- [ ] Define `object` in programming domain
- [ ] Create a class and instantiate an instance of the class
  - a class is a type of object
  - a blueprint for creating objects
- [ ] Explain the difference between a class and an instance
  - an instance is an object created from a blueprint
- [ ] Pass arguments to `new` by defining an initialize method in class
- [ ] Create instance methods
  - Define attribute readers and writers using `attr_` macros
  - setter, getter methods for instance variables
  - try to use instance variables only in initialize and setter/getter  
- [ ] Discuss methods as messages
  - getter method is actually a method called `balance=`
- [ ] Get more practice with array compositions (`each`, `map`, `select`/`filter`)
- [ ] Explain the need for variable scope and why it's important to not utilize global variables

## Deliverables

Here is a naive implementation of a bank account in Ruby using only a hash which stores key-value pairs.

```ruby
bank_account = {"owner_name": "soundarya", "balance": 100}
```

Write an implementation of a bank account that meets the following requirements:

- [ ] whale should return the account with the largest balance
- [ ] overdraw_warning should return all accounts under min balance of 300
- [ ] deposit should increase an account balance by a specific amount
- [ ] withdraw should decrease an account balance by a specific amount
