# I'll take "Review" for $1000, Alex.

Let's build out a trivia application using the skills we've learned over the past week.

As a user I should be able to:

    <!-- * See a question upon page load. -->
    <!-- * Click a button to see the answer -->
    <!-- * Click a button to hide the answer, and load the next question -->

Bonus:

    * Keep track of correct answers

The HTML and CSS are finished, you shouldn't need to make any changes to them, but if you do - explain your reasonsing, and describe at least one alternative method to achieve the same funtionality.
